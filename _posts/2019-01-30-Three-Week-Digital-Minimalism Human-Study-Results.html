<p><strong>3 Week Digital Minimalism Human Study Results</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been around 3 weeks since I started the digital minimalism &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiment. I wouldn't say I am a serious digital minimalist because I have &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to admit I sometimes use the internet to search up things that aren't my &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">top priority. Some are important, but not as of the present moment. I will &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">break down what I learned from not being on some websites I used to be on &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">quite often. I hope my experience will help you consider what you can do to &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">change your relationship with technology.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Blogs</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before: I used to read my favorite blog, MIT Admissions blogs, on the &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekends, but then it gradually became something on a daily basis if there &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">was a new blog. Even if it has provided me with a lot of information about &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MIT student life and culture, I think reading it was kind of unhealthy. I &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably spent more time on this than YouTube.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After: I learned that missing out isn't necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">commenting on their posts and reading some inspirational blogs, but it &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">became a habit that made me think about MIT everyday. I didn't want to &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">become obsessed with college, so I decided that it wasn't bad to take a &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">break from it. Just as what Danny and Allan G. from the blogs said, reading &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">these blogs religiously gave them a lot of pressure, as if that was their &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">only choice. I learned that even if I am very interested in the blogs, it &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn't mean I have to read it every single time. I think I would read them &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">around decision and essay season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> YouTube</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before: I used to watch YouTube videos for leisure on the weekends around &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">15-20 minutes a day for a total of 40 minutes. Some videos on my &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended were tempting to watch but didn't really have any meaningful &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">value or good content, such as reactions to colleges decisions or scores. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were some vlogs that caught my attention but didn't really interest &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">me but I still clicked on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After: I realized that my life is more peaceful because now my brain &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn't have to remind myself to check YouTube on the weekends. I got rid &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of FOMO from YouTube. As of now, my life isn't worse off without YouTube &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">because there are other forms of entertainment. For this period, I used &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube for videos related to school or projects. What I learned was that I &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn't need to watch videos on my recommended because the channels I &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">subscribed to had better content than some recommended ones. I think &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube is helpful if you watch videos about self-help and advice, such as &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas Frank and John Fish. In my opinion, I think watching his videos were &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LinkedIn</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before: When my mom would bring up this smart kid everyone in the community &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">knew or her friend's kids that attended an Ivy League school, I would &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">search up their LinkedIn profile to know what they were studying and what &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">achievements they had in high school. Although it gave me some glimpse &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">about them, it made me have lower self-esteem because I was comparing &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">my "brag sheet" to theirs. It made me feel quite mediocre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After: I don't go on LinkedIn because I don't need to go on LinkedIn as I &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">am not finding jobs or anything. It has made me stop comparing myself to &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">other geniuses because I don't know their GPA, scores, or awards. If I am &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">going to become an intern, I probably need one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> News</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before: I would search up daily news headlines on Google and read the &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">headlines briefly. It gradually became an automatic habit. Although it &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn't take up much of my time, it was kind of pointless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After: Although I spent little time on the news, it took away a bit of &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital declutter. I believe that it is important to be informed about &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">current events, but I would eventually hear about these events from my &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">family or my classmates. It wasn't necessary to search them up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if we all use similar websites, I know that everyone's digital life is &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">unique. Is technology holding you back from what you want your life to be? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that unhappiness happens when our expectations in life doesn't &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">align with what actually happens in life, and you have some control over &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">that when it comes to technology. Practice mindful curiosity. Think of what &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you feel when you consume lots of digital media. It is not enough to know &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">something is bad for you. Once you connect that experience with what you &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">felt (physically, emotionally, mentally), then it is a lot easier to end a &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad habit.</span></p>
