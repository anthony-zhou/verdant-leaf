<p>Ever since we are little, we are told to never give up, no matter how hard  
it may seem. However, there are exceptions. Recently, I have felt  
unmotivated when I was practicing for the AMC 10, a math competition that  
most participate in. For quite a while, I didn't exactly enjoy math because  
I got most questions wrong. Then, I would get mad myself and over time, my  
self confidence was worse than before. However, I still persevered and  
practiced for the AMC. It was like banging my head against the wall over  
and over again. Ok, I did improve compared to last year, but I was nowhere  
close to achieving the next round. Why? I was confused if quitting was a  
bad thing, especially because I heard a lot of times that quitters never  
win. I needed time for reflection. In fact, I should have re-evaluated  
myself a long time ago.</p>
<p>I read <i>Barking Up the Wrong Tree</i> during Thanksgiving break both for fun and  
to learn something, but I didn't sit down for an hour and ask myself these  
questions. In Chapter 3, Eric Barker talks about when someone should not  
give up and when it is acceptable to give up. He asked the reader a few  
questions, as if it was some game. Based on the fact that I was quite  
clueless, I decided to use the WOOP method. WOOP stands for Wish, Outcome,  
Obstacle, and Plan. After doing that, I realized that my actions didn't  
completely align with what I actually liked to do. Now, I am at peace with  
myself and I accept the fact that competition math isn't my strong suit and  
that is okay.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been picking up USNCO because I enjoyed it more and was  
more efficient when I learned about chemistry than doing math problems.  
Even if I got problems wrong, I was less frustrated. Rather than feeling  
discouraged, I wanted to know what I did wrong.</p>
<p>I think I have diverged off the title about the dilemma a lot of us face. 
In short, you sometimes have to give up to go up. I hate to be hard on you,  
but you can't be perfect at everything or else you are excellent at  
NOTHING. If you actually don't like something and doesn't go with what you  
actually value in life, then stop doing it! That is why we have the ability  
to make decisions.</p>
