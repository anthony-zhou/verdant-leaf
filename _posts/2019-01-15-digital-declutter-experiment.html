<p>Like most weekends, I would passively consume information by surfing the  
internet about stupid things, like the news. I would feel drained,  
exhausted, and confused why I even used the computer in the first place.  
Sometimes, I felt like I was controlled by the computer. This would consume  
around 3 hours of my entire week. I would beat myself up, wondering why was  
I wasting time on things that really didn't matter. I was sick of it and  
wanted a better life.</p>
<p>Inspired by Cal Newport, I started participating in the 30-day digital  
declutter near the end of 2018. Cal Newport's idea about digital minimalism  
comprises 3 parts. The first part was to take a break from optional  
technologies. Although I don't use social media, which is an optional  
technology that Newport criticizes the most, some other optional  
technologies I do includes reading blogs, watching YouTube, searching  
random things online, and messaging with my friends.
The second part was to identify what really matters in life, which include  
hobbies and personal goals. These goals should be accomplished within the  
whole month. For me, that would be playing a new piece on the piano or  
reading 4 books. Last but not least, the third part is to reintroduce  
technologies that are NECESSARY to achieve your goals. I haven't finished  
the 30-day challenge, so that question will be answered by the end of  
January.</p>
<p>It has only been the first day, but my life has been much better. I feel  
like time is slower and I have some control over it. My mind is more clear  
and I am actually doing things that matter in my life. Now, I am reading a  
book instead of wasting time on the computer. Somehow, it feels like the  
less time I spend on the computer, the happier I feel. This reminds me of  
the new movement of JOMO, which is the joy of missing out. I feel relieved  
that I don't have daily anxieties that used to remind me to check trivial  
stuff. I am not saying that we should go back to the old days and give up  
using any form of digital technology. What I am saying is that we should  
only use technology that is intentional and related to our goals and  
values. For instance, if you want to learn a new subject that would require  
listening to videos online, this would be a form of essential technology  
because the benefits of watching lectures outweigh the downsides.
To end this post, my question for you is this: is digital technology  
interfering with your personal goals and values? If so, how are you going  
to change that?</p>

<div>This post isn't necessarily to endorse Science Olympiad as the most inspirational extracurricular activity but to suggest how participating in these types of activities expand your skills and knowledge that can't be found in everyday classes. Most importantly, it changes your personality for the better.</div>
