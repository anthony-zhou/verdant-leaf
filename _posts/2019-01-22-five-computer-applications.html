<p>With more and more content online, it is easier for one to be distracted
easily by cute cat videos and end up watching other random videos for 2
hours. But don't lose hope. I will mention some useful applications on your
computer that can boost your productivity. I hope that some of these
applications/extensions are new to you and can help you. After using these
applications, I am more focused and usually check distracting activities
once a day during the weekdays. On the weekends, I might cheat and check
distracting websites more than I should be, but my relationship with the
computer definitely has improved.</p>
<ol>
<li>StayFocusd: This chrome extension is a good starter. After using the
maximum amount of time allowed per day for the blocked sites, StayFocusd
blocks them. There is also a nuclear option, which can block every single
website or all websites except for allowed ones. The problem with
StayFocusd is that it only works on Google Chrome, and if you still feel
tempted to watch YouTube, you can technically go on other browsers.</li>
<li>Cold Turkey: This app helps you block websites on ALL browsers. You can
make multiple lists if some websites should be blocked for a different
length of time, such as for a month or even an entire year. The premium
version can block distracting applications, such as video games or email.</li>
<li>Time Tracker: This tracks the amount of time you spend on Google
Chrome. It is a good reminder of how much time you spend on a website. When
pressed, the extension organizes the websites from most time consuming to
least time-consuming. Unfortunately, it can't track time spent on
applications or other browsers.</li>
<li>Rescue Time: Personally, Time Tracker isn't really necessary if you
install Rescue Time. What Rescue Time does well is that it gives weekly
reports and a productivity rating based on the type of websites and
applications you use the most frequently. They have categories for the
websites and applications based on how productive they are. You can change
the categories for the websites/applications if you think it is more
productive/distracting than they automatically set it to be.</li>
<li>Remove Recommendations YouTube VK Facebook: I wouldn't say I use this
the most, but it has made me less addicted to YouTube. Before, I would
watch more YouTube videos because of the recommendations on the homepage
and on the side of the main video. This extension can also hide comments,
playlists, and trending videos. By hiding recommendations, I use YouTube
differently compared to before.</li>
</ol>
<p>A good questions you may have is "Thanks for those applications, but what
if I am tempted to go on the phone?" I honestly can't help you there, but
don't worry! On the iPhone, you can go to settings and restrict the
websites you don't want and someone can make up a password that you don't
know. That will be another article to talk about phones!</p>
