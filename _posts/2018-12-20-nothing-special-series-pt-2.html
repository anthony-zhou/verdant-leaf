<p>Everyone has unique insight: you just have to ask the right questions. In this series, we probe into the lives of "average" people, along the way encountering the undeniable beauty of human life.</p> <p>Here in part two, we meet a politically refined thinker with an ear for music.</p>  <b>Which party do you stand with?</b>  <p>In my opinion, it’s not about the party. I’m with whichever one’s better.</p>  <b>If there was one thing you could change about our government, what would it be?</b>  <p>The current president.</p>  <b>Who is your favorite politician?</b>  <p>Queen Elizabeth II. It’s amazing how she’s such an icon but has no actual power.</p>  <b>Who is your least favorite politician?</b>  <p>Trump. He’s just stupid.</p>  <b>If you were president for one day, what would you do?</b>  <p>I wouldn’t change any laws, I’d just chill at the white house. Prank the secret service and act like I’m dead or something.</p>  <b>In your opinion, what’s the best country and why?</b>  <p>Probably the United States. I mean, I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else.</p>  <b>Who do you think is the most admirable world leader?</b>  <p>Queen Elizabeth II. Because their country isn’t as much of a mess as ours.</p>  <b>Outside of politics, who is the person you admire most, historical or contemporary?</b>  <p>I gotta go with lil’ pump. The way he does everything is just amazing. The way he came to fame, the way he carries himself, it’s just otherworldly.</p>  <b>Finally, what’s your greatest life accomplishment?</b>  <p>A 4 on the AP Human Geography Exam.</p>
