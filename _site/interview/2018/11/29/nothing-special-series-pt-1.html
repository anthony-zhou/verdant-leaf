<h1>"Nothing Special" - Interviews with Regular People - Part One</h1>
<p>29 Nov 2018 - jamie</p>
<p>Everyone has unique insight: you just have to ask the right questions. In this series,  we probe into the lives of "average" people, along the way encountering the undeniable beauty of human life.</p> <p>Part one sees a DOTA II player with a taste for history. Here he is:</p> <br />  <b>Q: What do you doevery morning?</b>  <p>A: I brush my teeth (would recommend!), look over my schedule, and check social media.</p> <br /> <b>Q: What is your life&rsquo;s greatest accomplishment?</b>  <p>A: Being 82nd percentile in DOTA II</p> <br /> <b>Q: What advice would you give?</b>  <p>A: You could be great at everything if you put 1000 hours into it.</p> <br /> <b>Q: If you were to recommend one book, what would it be?</b>  <p>A: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Titans-History-Giants-Made-World/dp/0525564462"><i>Titans of History</i></a>   by Simon Sebag Montefiore. It teaches you a lot about history, and you can see how the past affects future. </p> <br /> <b>Q: Favorite movie?</b>  <p>A: The Harry Potter series, all of them.</p> <br /> <b>Q: Favorite show?</b>  <p>A: <i>Game of Thrones</i>. It's entertaining (and educational) to watch backstabbing in politics.</p> <br /> <b>Q: What&rsquo;s your favorite pastime?</b>  <p>A: Enjoying time with friends. It shows you how other people think and act.</p> <br /> <b>Q: Who is the person you most admire (historical or present)?</b>  <p>A: Otto von Bismarck. He single handedly eliminated the French!</p> <br /> <b>Q: If you were President of the United States of America for one day, what would you do first?</b>  <p>A: First, I would go tell Putin he&rsquo;s a flipping lunatic. Then I&rsquo;d completely revamp the healthcare and school systems. All in a day&rsquo;s work! </p> <br /> <p>Stay tuned for part two of this series!</p> <style> /*Just for this interview series*/ b { 	font-weight: 600; } </style>
