<h1>What does it take to be a varsity athlete?</h1>
<p>12 Oct 2018 - Allen Z</p>
<p>Not everyone has what it takes to be a varsity athlete.      Depending on the school, getting play time or even making the team can be very difficult.      The practices and games will often be physically and mentally demanding and coaches will expect players to give more than 100% effort 24/7.      However, even though playing sports in school is tough, it is also an incredibly rewarding experience.      It helps you to stay in shape, make friends, and most of all, it allows you to have fun doing what you love.  </p> <img src = "../../../../assets/images/night-soccer.jpg" alt="Soccer players on a field at night">     <p>To help you understand what it is like to be a student athlete,      we interviewed a few 6A high school varsity athletes on work out habits, dieting, and more.     The questions and response are recorded below:</p>      <br> <b> Are you a varsity athlete? If so, for what sport(s)? </b> <p>Student 1: Yes, soccer. <br> Student 2: Yes, cross country. <br> Student 3: Yes, lacrosse. </p>  <b> How active are you? How many days per week and hours per day do you work out? </b> <p>Student 1: Very active, about 11 hours a week and 1.5-2.5 hours a day. <br> Student 2: Very active, 7 days per week, around 3-4 hours per day.<br> Student 3: Very active, 1.5 hours in the morning weight lifting and 1.5 hours after school practice 15 hours a week.</p> <b> Are you on a diet? </b> <p>Student 1: No. <br> Student 2: I have cut all saturated fats possible and only drink water + Gatorade. <br> Student 3: Eat 3500 calories a day. </p>  <b>How often do you practice individually? </b> <p>Student 1: 6 times a week for about 30 minutes. <br> Student 2: 7 days a week for about 2 hours. <br> Student 3: 6 times a week in the morning 1.5 hours. </p> <b> Do you think mentality or physicality is more important? </b> <p> Student 1: Mentality, it's better for the long run in the season and allows you to achieve more. <br> Student 2: Mentality, it doesn’t matter how fast you can run if you can’t push through the pain it takes to reach that next level. <br> Student 3: Mentality, the thing that matters the most is approaching things with the right mentality  and for physicality to come, you have to have the right mindset. </p>  <b> What is one piece of advice you would give to someone aspiring to be a varsity athlete?</b> <p>Student 1: You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. <br> Student 2: The first step in being great is believing that YOU can achieve your goals. <br> Student 3: Understand that nothing is given and outwork everyone to earn your spot. Put in extra.  </p>  <b> Do you want to go professional, and if so, do you think you’re good enough? What team? If not, why?</b> <p>Student 1: No, it's not my aspiration to play professional. <br> Student 2: No, to go professional in running you have to have a very fast mile time in order to close races fast,  while I can run a fairly fast mile time it is nowhere near what is required for pro level. <br> Student 3: No, professional lacrosse players get paid between 10 and 20 thousand and it is more of a hobby than a job. </p>  <b> What is your favorite sports team or player? </b> <p>Student 1: Manchester United. <br> Student 2: Mo Farah. <br> Student 3: USA national lacrosse team. </p>  <br> <b>Now that you know what it takes, don’t waste a moment, get out there and practice! </b>
