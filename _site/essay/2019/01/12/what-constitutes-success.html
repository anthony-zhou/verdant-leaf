<h1>What Constitutes Success?</h1>
<p>12 Jan 2019 - Vivian Hir</p>
<p>As students, we are told to get good grades, study for tests, and take the  
most challenging classes. We admire and aspire to become the class  
valedictorian or salutatorian. Most of us predict that these people will  
become very successful in life ( I mean successful as in becoming a  
millionaire and famous in their field). However, my perspective about this  
changed after I read Eric Barker's <i>Barking Up the Wrong Tree</i>. Barker's book  
debunks common myths about success. In the beginning, he mentions how  
according to a university study, most valedictorians don't become  
millionaires*. At first, this was a surprise to me. How could it be these  
smart geniuses that don't become millionaires? He said that valedictorians  
follow the rules as I stated before and conform to society's expectations.  
Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are supposed to break the rules and focus  
on their passion rather than becoming a generalist by taking every single  
hard class. In fact, the average GPA for an entrepreneur is a 2.9. This is  
not to say that every single entrepreneur was a bad student because some of  
them went to decent colleges. The point is that they were willing to take  
risks and not follow what society considered as normal. In reality, life is  
supposed to throw us some curve balls. It is not a planned out road.</p>

<p>Why I am mentioning this is because I have conflicting feelings about what  
I define as success. I find it quite ironic as my true thoughts don't align  
with my actions. I feel this self-fulfilling prophecy that because I am  
doing what everyone else is doing, I will be a normal person in life,  
working in an office and not necessarily contributing to society. I don't  
want to be that type of person, but my current actions reflect that because  
like many other students, I care a lot about my grades and try to take  
every single weighted class offered.</p>

<p>*I am not saying that valedictorians won't be successful in life. It is  
just that they have to understand that in real life, life rewards people  
that take risks and not follow the crowd.</p>

<div>This post isn't necessarily to endorse Science Olympiad as the most inspirational extracurricular activity but to suggest how participating in these types of activities expand your skills and knowledge that can't be found in everyday classes. Most importantly, it changes your personality for the better.</div>
