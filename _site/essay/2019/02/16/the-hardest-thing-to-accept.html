<h1>The Hardest Thing to Accept&#58; Inevitability of Mistakes</h1>
<p>16 Feb 2019 - Vivian Hir</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As a hardworking student who constantly strives for straight As,
  a weakness that comes with this trait is having low self-esteem by not accepting
  the fact that I will keep making mistakes. These mistakes range from doing labs
  incorrectly to writing mediocre essays on tests. Despite using my reflection process
  (study like Darwin) after a test, lab, or assignment, I still make similar mistakes
  such as a calculation error or forgetting to do something. This repeated cycle of
  criticizing myself for not following my expectations has only made it harder for
  me and feel obliged to always improve instead of falling down and then getting
  back up. Looking back on my previous failures, I realized that the best way to
  deal with failure is to not make it very personal. One of the most important skills
  I developed from some failures was seeing it as a temporary situation and not an
  apocalyptic situation. In other words, I didn&rsquo;t let my current situation
  determine my future. Instead, I would treat it like a postmortem and examine why
  I made mistakes and how I could do better. I accepted that making mistakes was
  natural and that failure was a learning opportunity for me. I used my failure to
  motivate me to do better. It would make me be more aware and informed about how
  to tackle a future challenge that I may encounter. In fact, it was a good reminder
  that I was being challenged. Although every student dreams of having perfect grades,
  it may not be a very good sign because having perfect grades may indicate that you
  aren&rsquo;t learning much from the class.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The internal conflict hasn&rsquo;t really been resolved because
  I still struggle with the difference between confidence and arrogance, but what
  I can attempt to do is to not make my mistakes make a generalized statement about
  who I am as a person. Usually, I exaggerate how bad my character is by calling myself
  irresponsible, careless, immature because I forgot to do my history homework assignment
  or forgot the negative signs for a physics lab. This may sound silly, but I think of how
  my teachers think about me in a disappointed manner after I didn&rsquo;t do well on a
  test or assignment. I have this assumption that teachers expect their good students to
  consistently do well. That thinking needs to stop. Rather let my past define me, I
  can seize the moment to try to improve in the future. Another way to prevent me
  from entering a downward spiral of beating myself up for the smallest mistakes
  is to redefine what improvement should look like. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t have
  this mindset, but I see improvement as a straight, linear line that keeps going
  up over time. Perhaps I should visualize improvement as a graph that has both high
  and low peaks, but over a stretch of time there is a positive correlation. &nbsp;Most
  importantly, I have to let go of my unwillingness to accept the fact that I will
  still make the same mistakes. Even if I make the same mistakes, as long as I am more
  aware and gradually do less of those mistakes, I should feel better for myself. </span></p>
