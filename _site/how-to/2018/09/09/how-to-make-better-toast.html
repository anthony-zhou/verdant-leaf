        it is a science. </a>Consistently creating a crispy, golden-brown
      exterior and a soft, flavorful interior requires extreme care, from the cooking
      time to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/shopping/2006/03/toast_of_the_town.html">
        the model of toaster</a>, to even the way the bread is sliced. </p>
